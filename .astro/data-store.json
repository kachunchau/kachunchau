Our team of 5 (Head of Product, Product Designer, and 3 Engineers) with resources constraints had to move fast to close key feature gaps and remain competitive.\n\nUsing Sketch for design and React for development, we focused on reducing confusion between different setting types while improving overall usability, consistency, and scalability.\n\n### Impact\n\nAs a result of releasing the redesign settings, support requests related to user-level and project-level settings decreased, contributing to less customer frustration.\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe settings experience in Vero 2.0 was disjointed and unintuitive. Users struggled to find and manage settings related to projects and user preferences. With no clear structure, it was easy to get lost especially as the platform scaled.\n\nTo understand the key challenges, I collaborated with the Head of Product, who provided product goals and insights gathered from the customer and success teams.\n\n### Pain Points\n\n- There was no clear distinction between user-level and project-level settings, causing confusion\n  around which settings affected what.\n- As more settings from Vero 1.0 are integrated into Vero 2.0, the lack of hierarchical\n  clarity is becoming increasingly problematic.\n- Users can't customise their user profile by adding an image.\n- The concept of an organisation layer introduces a new level of complexity, with\n  no existing structure to support organisation-specific settings.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Organize all settings into a clear, logical structure.\n- Improve navigation and clarity.\n- Use consistent design patterns for every setting type.\n- Build a scalable system for future features.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nAt the time, Vero 2.0 had a small user base. This created a **low-risk environment** for iteration, allowing us to make fast, confident design decisions without needing to run large-scale UX research.\n\nTo inform those decisions, we collaborated closely with the Customer and Success teams to surface feedback. Their experience helped us identify recurring pain points and edge cases that might not have been obvious.\n\nWe also worked with the founder to conduct a comprehensive audit of all existing user-level and project-level settings. This was to decide which settings to migrate over from the Vero 1.0 to Vero 2.0 and which to deprecate.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={featureAuditImage}\n    alt=\"Feature audit\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Feature comparistion table of the two products\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nDue to time and resource constraints, I took a Lean UX approach—quickly creating\nlightweight user personas based on known user behaviors and context. This allowed for\nfast, informed design decisions without delaying the process.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl\"\n    src={emilyPersonaImage}\n    densities={[1, 2]}\n    alt=\"Emily's user persona\"\n\n/>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Emily's user persona\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl\"\n    src={davidPersonaImage}\n    densities={[1, 2]}\n    alt=\"David's user persona\"\n\n/>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>David's user persona\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl\"\n    src={ninaPersonaImage}\n    densities={[1, 2]}\n    alt=\"Nina's user persona\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Nina's user persona\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Competitive analysis\n\nTo guide our design approach, we also reviewed how tools in adjacent\nindustries—such as Netlify and Vercel—organised their settings, drawing\ninspiration from proven patterns.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"!my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl outline outline-black/5\"\n      src={netlifyImage}\n      alt=\"Screenshot of Netlify for competitor analysis\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Screenshot of Netlify for competitor analysis\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"!my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl outline outline-black/5\"\n      src={vercelImage}\n      alt=\"Screenshot of Vercel for competitor analysis\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Screenshot of Vercel for competitor analysis\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Exploring Designs\n\nHaving a Sketch component library allowed me to quickly explore mid to high-fidelity mockups, testing different ways to group and present the settings sidebar. I also explored key interaction states, including different layouts and behaviours for modals and dropdowns, to ensure consistency and usability across various settings types.\n\n- **Modal vs inline for profile settings:** Should profiles open in a modal for quick access, or be\n  embedded inline within the settings view?\n- **Inline vs full-screen views:** Should settings open up full-screen so the new settings could also be used in Vero 1.0?\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={accountProfileModalTypeImage}\n    alt=\"Account profile modal type\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\n    Srolling vs tabbed navigation in the account & profile modal\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={inlineFullScreenImage}\n    alt=\"Inline settings vs full-screen settings\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Inline settings vs full-screen settings\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI explored ways to differentiate project-level and user-level settings, and how\nmultiple projects should be represented in the sidebar.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 !my-0 md:col-span-2\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\"\n      src={settingsSidebarsImage}\n      alt=\"Settings sidebar exploration\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Settings sidebar exploration\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 !my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\"\n      src={nestedProjectsImage}\n      alt=\"Nested projects\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Nested projects\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\nI shared these mockups internally to gather feedback early. This collaborative process helped me evaluate trade-offs due to balancing business goals and technical constraints.\n\n### Concepts Not Pursued\n\nTo align with business goals, some features were moved to phase 2, allowing us to prioritise core features for a faster launch. One of these decisions included removing the 'add new project' feature, enabling us to deliver a leaner MVP within the 8-week timeframe.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={switcherNewProjectImage}\n    alt=\"Switcher new project\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Adding a new project from the switcher\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Refining Design\n\nI refined the mockups to balance usability, visual consistency, and technical constraints. During implementation once the bulk of the engineering work was done I jumped in to the code to do some design polish like refining spacing to ensure a more consistent and scalable experience.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\">\n      \u003CImage\n        class=\"!my-0 rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl\"\n        src={dataFeedsImage}\n        alt=\"Data feeds\"\n      />\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Data feeds\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 md:col-span-2\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\">\n      \u003CImage\n        class=\"!my-0 rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl\"\n        src={teamMembersImage}\n        alt=\"Team members\"\n      />\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Team members\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Release and iterate\n\nPost-release feedback revealed that the sidebar in the settings section felt visually disconnected from the rest of the app—due to differences in width and styling compared to the non-settings sidebar. To address this, I led a refinement of the layout by standardising the width and\naligning the styles of the settings sidebar to improve visual consistency.\n\nWith a small user base, the risk of shipping small iterative changes was low and the feedback loop was fast.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={settingsSidebarTweaksImage}\n      alt=\"Settings sidebar tweaks\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Settings sidebar tweaks post-launch\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## What I learned\n\nThis low-risk project gave me space to focus on usability and structure without the pressure of high-stakes outcomes. It was a chance to simplify complexity, aligning UI with underlying logic, and designing for long-term scalability—all while moving quickly and collaboratively within a small team.","src/work/settings.mdx",[35],"@images/settings@2x.png","eae203d31ac80a5a",true,"ab-testing",{"id":38,"data":40,"body":52,"filePath":53,"assetImports":54,"digest":56,"deferredRender":37},{"title":41,"description":42,"headline":42,"team":43,"role":28,"timeframe":29,"slug":38,"cover":48,"order":49,"gradient":50,"alignment":51},"AB Testing","Redesigning A/B Testing for newsletter-style campaigns",[44,45,46,47],{"name":18,"position":19},{"name":21,"position":22},{"name":24,"position":25},{"name":27,"position":25},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_@images/ab-testing@2x.png",3,"secondary","left","import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\n\nimport variantsImage from \"@images/variants@2x.png\";\nimport manualTestImage from \"@images/manual-test@2x.png\";\nimport pickAWinnerImage from \"@images/pick-a-winner@2x.png\";\n\n## Overview\n\nA 6 weeks design of adding A/B Testing to newsletter-style campaigns to Vero 2.0. I led the design to deliver a simple, scalable solution within a team of 5 (Head of Product, Product Designer, and 3 Engineers) — shipping was critical to retain a high-value customer.\n\nUsing Sketch for design and React/Ember for development, we aimed to modernise the flow, integrate it into the new design system, and ensure it supported complex campaign logic.\n\n### Impact\n\nShipping A/B Testing, helped accelerate Vero's go-to-market strategy, ticks of a feature to be migrated over to the new product and most importantly prevented a big customer from churning.\n\n## The Problem\n\n- Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key customer at\n  risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered quickly.\n- The challenge was to **migrate this feature quickly** from the legacy\n  platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to better fit the\n  new campaign builder model.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing experience.\n- Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the feature into\n  the new design system and component patterns..\n- Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign logic and\n  ensure a reliable user experience.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nDue to time constraints, I quickly researched how comparable platforms — Mailchimp, Drip, Campaign Monitor, and Braze handle A/B testing to identify common patterns and potential gaps. A few common insights emerged:\n\n- A/B testing features are often hidden or buried in advanced settings, making them easy to overlook or use incorrectly.\n- No **auto-pick winner option** — the user must manually select a winner, and if they forget, it can delay the final send.\n- Some platforms only support testing two variants, limiting experimentation flexibility.\n\nThis quick research helped shape the foundation of the design.\n\n### Exploring designs\n\nI shared early mockups internally to validate direction and ensure feasibility\nunder technical constraints and tight timelines. During this process, I realised that placing all variants within the same message panel created significant visual clutter, making it difficult to distinguish between variants once their 10.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage class=\"drop-shadow-xl\" src={variantsImage} alt=\"Variants\" />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Showing the variants in the same message panel\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTo mitigate the issue, I placed each variant in its own panel and added coloured highlights to indicate the status of the variant.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={manualTestImage}\n    alt=\"Manual test\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Manual test\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={pickAWinnerImage}\n    alt=\"Pick a winner\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Pick a winner\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## Release and Iterate\n\nWe shipped the redesigned A/B testing feature within weeks, retaining the customer who had flagged it as a deal-breaker.\n\n## What I learned\n\nThis project reinforced the value of designing lean but scalable solutions under pressure. We shipped fast to retain a high-value customer and unlock migration to the new platform—taking another step toward merging the 2 products into 1. It taught me how to prioritise, make pragmatic design decisions, and deliver a usable experience within tight time and resource constraints while still leaving room for future improvement.","src/work/ab-testing.mdx",[55],"@images/ab-testing@2x.png","45b85c7e2fe44d4a","air-hustle",{"id":57,"data":59,"body":69,"filePath":70,"assetImports":71,"digest":73,"deferredRender":37},{"company":60,"title":61,"description":62,"headline":62,"team":63,"role":65,"slug":57,"cover":66,"order":67,"gradient":68,"alignment":51},"Self-initiated","Air Hustle","Designing the experience for a flight deals aggregator",[64],{"name":21,"position":22},"Led UX, Led UI","__ASTRO_IMAGE_@images/splendid-flights@2x.png",1,"tertiary","import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\n\nimport notionPersonasImage from \"@images/notion-personas@2x.png\";\nimport userPersonasImage from \"@images/user-personas@2x.png\";\nimport saraJourneyImage from \"@images/sara-journey@2x.png\";\nimport marcusJourneyImage from \"@images/marcus-journey@2x.png\";\nimport leoJourneyImage from \"@images/leo-journey@2x.png\";\nimport userFlowImage from \"@images/user-flow@2x.png\";\nimport dmSansImage from \"@images/dm-sans@2x.png\";\nimport airHustleStyleGuideImage from \"@images/air-hustle-style-guide@2x.png\";\nimport ogSearchImage from \"@images/og-search@2x.png\";\nimport newSearchImage from \"@images/new-search@2x.png\";\nimport fromSearchImage from \"@images/from-search@2x.png\";\nimport toSearchImage from \"@images/to-search@2x.png\";\nimport explorationflightCardImage from \"@images/flight-card@2x.png\";\nimport filterImage from \"@images/filter@2x.png\";\nimport resultsImage from \"@images/results@2x.png\";\nimport moreDetailsImage from \"@images/more-details@2x.png\";\n\n## Overview\n\nA self-initiated UX/UI case study focused on simplifying the flight deals search experience.\nI developed this case study during a redundancy period, using the time to sharpen my skills and explore new design approaches. The goal was to reduce friction and help users quickly find deals and book through third-party platforms.\n\n## The Problem\n\nFinding affordable flights online can be frustrating. Many aggregator sites are cluttered with upsells, hidden fees, and too much information. Air Hustle aims to fix this with a clear, trustworthy platform for budget-conscious travellers who value price, simplicity, and transparency.\n\n### Identified pain points\n\n- Confusing pricing structures (eg hidden baggage or seat fees).\n- Overwhelming flight comparison interfaces.\n- Pressure from countdown timers and \"only 2 seats left!\" tactics.\n- Hidden information (does flight have wi-fi etc).\n- Inflexible booking tools for open-ended travel.\n- Visa or travel restriction info not surfaced during booking.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Keep UI simple and easy to use.\n- Avoid sales pressure tactics.\n- Show price up front.\n- Have options to show flights for power users.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nTo better understand user needs and pain points, I developed three user personas based on distinct travel behaviors. While these were created using assumed data for this case study, in a real-world scenario, they would be informed by qualitative and quantitative user research.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={notionPersonasImage}\n    alt=\"Storing personas in Notion\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>User personas in Notion\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={userPersonasImage}\n      alt=\"Inside each persona\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Each persona\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWith the personas in place, I created a user flow to visualise the key steps users take from landing on the site to selecting a deal and being redirected to a third-party booking platform.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={userFlowImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>User flow\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI then mapped each persona's journey through the search and booking process to identify key frustrations, motivations, and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={saraJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Sara's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={marcusJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Marcus's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={leoJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Leo's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nA common theme between the users is that the fights tend to have hidden baggage or seat fees so I will try to add transparent pricing or tooltips to reveal the prices.\n\n### Exploring Designs\n\nTo begin visualising the UI, I created wireframes in Whimsical.\n\n\u003Ciframe\n  class=\"aspect-video w-full\"\n  style=\"border:none\"\n  width=\"1280\"\n  height=\"640\"\n  src=\"https://whimsical.com/embed/VvcyisSJE6Cz18RwmH4GLG\"\n>\u003C/iframe>\n\nThese wireframes were kept simple, emphasising layout. The goal at this stage was to quickly try out layouts for key elements such as the search bar, filters, and flight results, without getting distracted by styling details. Inspired by established platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner. These early wireframes helped identify opportunities to improve usability and guided the next phase of iterative design.\n\n### Style Guide\n\nFor typography, I used DM Sans for its simple, geometric, and modern style. It feels fresh and approachable an ideal fit for a flight deals aggregator with a diverse user base. It has a nice balance between being professional and welcoming, which helps build trust without feeling too corporate or cold.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={dmSansImage}\n      alt=\"Typography choice\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>DM Sans\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI chose blue as the primary color because it's non-intrusive and calming—making it a solid foundation for interfaces that users interact with regularly. It's also colorblind-friendly, which helps improve accessibility for a broader range of users.\n\nTo allow more flexibility, I included a typographic scale in the style guide rather than assigning fixed weights to headings.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={airHustleStyleGuideImage}\n      alt=\"Typography choice\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Style guide\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI developed high-fidelity mockups from the wireframes, applying a 4px vertical spacing system for visual consistency. I also ensured buttons were at least 40px tall to meet accessibility standards and support ease of interaction across devices.\n\n### Refining Designs\n\nSince search is the most important feature of a flight deals site, I made it more prominent by visually separating it from the background, breaking it out of the hero and adding a shadow for emphasis.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={ogSearchImage}\n      alt=\"Original search design\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Original search design\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nReviewing the design:\n\n- The search look cluttered due to the spacing between inputs\n- The return date toggle appeared visually off\n- The to/from switch icon resembled a refresh symbol\n\nI made some tweaks with the above feedback in mind. As this is a self-initiated project, I haven't done formal user testing, but my decisions are based on usability best practices.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={newSearchImage}\n      alt=\"Tweaked search design\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Tweaked search design\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTo make the search more intuitive, I added location-based auto-suggestions using the user's IP address so users can quickly select a location. Additionally, I included recent searches to support power users with faster access to frequently used locations. While populating the from destination with popular destinations for people unsure where to go.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={fromSearchImage}\n      alt=\"From search dropdown\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>From search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={toSearchImage}\n      alt=\"To search dropdown\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>To search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI structured the exploration flight cards with the F-shaped scanning pattern in mind, placing key details where users' eyes naturally land first.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={explorationflightCardImage}\n      alt=\"Flight card\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Exploration flight cards\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThe fly anywhere filter menu helps users easily explore destinations that match their travel interests.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={filterImage}\n      alt=\"Fly anywhere filter\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Fly anywhere filters\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI've kept the search minimal on the results page to maximize space for flight listings, but it will expand when clicked.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\" src={resultsImage} alt=\"Results card\" />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Flight results with the search minimised\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nDue to the UI being quite busy on these results pages I added a button to reveal more details for the flights to highlight any hidden costs, such as seat selection fees or checked baggage charges.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={moreDetailsImage}\n      alt=\"Flight card with expanded detail view\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>More details for flights\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nAlthough this self-initiated case study didn't involve live user testing, I based design decisions on heuristics, competitor patterns (like Kayak and Skyscanner), and common usability principles.\n\nSee the full mockups below:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"relative left-0 h-224 w-full\">\n  \u003Ciframe\n    class=\"aspect-video\"\n    src=\"https://www.sketch.com/embed/s/6d9d8d80-49fb-494b-93f6-49abdc8e0fe5\"\n    style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\"\n    allowfullscreen\n  >\u003C/iframe>\n\u003C/div>\n\n## What I learned\n\nIn a real-world scenario, to improve the flight deals search experience, usability testing would concentrate on how easily users navigate the search filters, interpret and interact with results, and complete the booking process through third-party platforms.\n\nTo ensure a seamless and effective flight search experience, I would focus on tracking metrics such as:\n\n- **Task Completion Rate** - % of users who successfully complete the entire flow (search → explore → select → book) without dropping off.\n- **Abandonment Rate** - Where users leave the flow (eg after search, during selection, before booking). This helps identify friction point.\n- **Conversion Rate** - Number of support tickets related to the flight booking process—high numbers might signal UX issues.","src/work/air-hustle.mdx",[72],"@images/splendid-flights@2x.png","9c18003e1249f648","journeys",{"id":74,"data":76,"body":87,"filePath":88,"assetImports":89,"digest":91,"deferredRender":37},{"title":77,"description":78,"headline":78,"team":79,"role":28,"timeframe":29,"draft":37,"slug":74,"cover":84,"href":85,"order":86},"Journeys","Bringing automated multi-messages to Vero 2.0",[80,81,82,83],{"name":18,"position":19},{"name":21,"position":22},{"name":24,"position":25},{"name":27,"position":25},"__ASTRO_IMAGE_@images/journeys@2x.png",false,4,"import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\n\n## Overview\n\n## The Problem\n\n## Goals\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\n### Competitive analysis\n\n### Exploring Designs\n\n### Concepts Not Pursued\n\n## Release and iterate","src/work/journeys.mdx",[90],"@images/journeys@2x.png","11e38fb8eb88e679"]
