These formed the foundation for my design exploration and decision-making.\n\n### Identified Problems\n\n- The settings section was fragmented, making it hard to manage projects, accounts, and user preferences.\n- There was no clear distinction between user-level and project-level settings, causing confusion around which settings affected what.\n- As more settings from Vero 1.0 are integrated into Vero 2.0, the lack of hierarchical clarity is becoming increasingly problematic.\n- Users can't customise their user profile by adding an image.\n- There was no clear structure or consistent design.\n- The concept of an organisation layer introduces a new level of complexity, with no existing structure to support organisation-specific settings.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Organize all settings into a clear, logical structure.\n- Improve navigation and clarity.\n- Use consistent design patterns for every setting type.\n- Build a scalable system for future features.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nCollaborated with the Head of Product to conduct a comprehensive audit of all existing settings across user roles and project types. This was also to decide which settings to port over from the Vero 1.0 to Vero 2.0 and which to deprecate.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-yellow-50\"\n    src={featureAuditImage}\n    alt=\"Feature audit\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Feature comparistion table of the two products\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTo guide our design approach, we also reviewed how tools in adjacent industries—such as Netlify and Vercel—organised their settings, drawing inspiration from proven patterns.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"!my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl outline outline-black/5\"\n      src={netlifyImage}\n      alt=\"Screenshot of Netlify for competitor analysis\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Screenshot of Netlify for competitor analysis\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"!my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl outline outline-black/5\"\n      src={vercelImage}\n      alt=\"Screenshot of Vercel for competitor analysis\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Screenshot of Vercel for competitor analysis\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Exploring designs\n\nWe have a Sketch library our our components and I explored different mid to hi-fidelity mockups—testing different ways to group and present the settings sidebar.
