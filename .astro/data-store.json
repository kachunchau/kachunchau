The goal was to modernise the flow,\nintegrate it into the new design system, and ensure it supported complex\ncampaign logic. I worked closely with engineers to polish the UI, maintain\nconsistency, and test functionality.\n\n## The Problem\n\n- Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key customer at\n  risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered quickly.\n- The challenge was to migrate this functionality quickly from the legacy\n  platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to better fit the\n  new campaign builder model.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing experience.\n- Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the feature into\n  the new design system and component patterns..\n- Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign logic and\n  ensure a reliable user experience.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nResearched how similar tools (like Mailchimp, Customer.io, and Braze) handled\nA/B testing, especially how they explained traffic split, metrics, and variant\nselection.\n\n### Exploring designs\n\nShared early mockups internally to validate direction and ensure feasibility\nunder technical constraints and tight timelines.\n\n### Refining design\n\nWorked closely with product and engineering to scope a realistic MVP version\nthat covered core functionality but allowed for future iteration.\n\nSince it was quite difficult to tell the variants apart, I added a coloured highlight to differentiate them based on their status.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={manualTestImage}\n

Users had trouble managing accounts, projects, and preferences without getting lost. I led the redesign of the entire settings system to make it easier to use, more consistent, and ready to scale.\n\n## The Problem\n\nTo understand the key challenges, I collaborated with the Head of Product, who provided problem statements grounded in strategic product goals and insights gathered from internal teams and user feedback channels. These formed the foundation for my design exploration and decision-making.\n\n### Identified Problems\n\n- The settings section was fragmented, making it hard to manage projects, accounts, and user preferences.\n- There was no clear distinction between user-level and project-level settings, causing confusion around which settings affected what.\n- As more settings from Vero 1.0 are integrated into Vero 2.0, the lack of hierarchical clarity is becoming increasingly problematic.\n- Users can't customise their user profile by adding an image.\n- There was no clear structure or consistent design.\n- The concept of an organisation layer introduces a new level of complexity, with no existing structure to support organisation-specific settings.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Organize all settings into a clear, logical structure.\n- Improve navigation and clarity.\n- Use consistent design patterns for every setting type.\n- Build a scalable system for future features.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nCollaborated with the Head of Product to conduct a comprehensive audit of all existing settings across user roles and project types. This was also to decide which settings to port over from the Vero 1.0 to Vero 2.0 and which to deprecate.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={featureAuditImage}\n    alt=\"Feature audit\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Feature comparistion table of the two products\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nDue to time and resource constraints, I took a Lean UX approach—quickly creating lightweight personas based on known user behaviors and context. This allowed for fast, informed design decisions without delaying the process.\n\n{(() => {\nconst userPersonas = [\n{\nname: \"Emily\",\nage: 29,\noccupation: \"Product Manager\",\ngoal: \"Quickly find and adjust both personal and project settings to manage her team efficiently.\",\npainPoint: \"Gets confused when settings for different scopes (user vs. project) are mixed together without clear separation.\",\nbehaviour: \"Frequently switches between projects, values a clean, organized interface.\"\n},\n{\nname: \"David\",\nage: 34,\noccupation: \"Developer\",\ngoal: \"Access technical settings swiftly without distractions or extra clicks..\",\npainPoint: \"Finds overly complex or cluttered settings frustrating and time-consuming.\",\nbehaviour: \"Uses settings sparingly but expects them to be precise and streamlined.\"\n},\n{\nname: \"Nina\",\nage: 24,\noccupation: \"Marketing Analyst\",\ngoal: \"Navigate and update her profile and notification preferences without confusion.\",\npainPoint: \"Struggles with unclear terminology or ambiguous labels in the settings interface.\",\nbehaviour: \"Uses settings occasionally, prefers intuitive UI that requires little guidance.\"\n}\n];\n\nconst displayNames = {\npainPoint: \"Pain Points\",\n};\n\nreturn (\n\n\u003Cdiv className=\" grid gap-8 md:gap-10 max-w-3xl md:mx-16\">\n  {userPersonas.map((persona, index) => (\n    \u003Cdiv className=\"bg-slate-50 ring-slate-100 ring-1 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl\" key={index}>\n      \u003Cdiv className=\"font-semibold px-4 py-2\">{persona.name}\u003C/div>\n      {Object.entries(persona).map(\n        ([key, value]) =>\n          key !== \"name\" && (\n            \u003Cdiv className=\"grid even:bg-white grid-cols-5\" key={key}>\n              \u003Cspan className=\"px-4 col-span-2 py-2 capitalize font-medium\">{displayNames[key] || key}: \u003C/span>\n              \u003Cspan className=\"col-span-3 px-4 py-2\">{value}\u003C/span>\n            \u003C/div>\n          ),\n      )}\n    \u003C/div>\n\n))}\n\n\u003C/div>\n); })()}\n\nTo guide our design approach, we also reviewed how tools in adjacent industries—such as Netlify and Vercel—organised their settings, drawing inspiration from proven patterns.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-2 gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"!my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl outline outline-black/5\"\n      src={netlifyImage}\n      alt=\"Screenshot of Netlify for competitor analysis\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Screenshot of Netlify for competitor analysis\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"!my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl outline outline-black/5\"\n      src={vercelImage}\n      alt=\"Screenshot of Vercel for competitor analysis\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Screenshot of Vercel for competitor analysis\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\n### Exploring Designs\n\nWe have a Sketch library our our components and I explored different mid to hi-fidelity mockups—testing different ways to group and present the settings sidebar. I shared these iterations regularly internally to gather feedback early. This collaborative process helped me evaluate trade-offs due to balancing business goals or technical constraints.\n\n- **Modal vs inline for profile settings:** Should profiles open in a modal for quick access, or be embedded inline within the settings view?\n- **Inline vs full-screen views:** Should settings open up full-screen so the new settings could also be used in Vero 1.0?\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={accountProfileModalTypeImage}\n    alt=\"Account profile modal type\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\n    Srolling vs tabbed navigation in the account & profile modal\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={inlineFullScreenImage}\n    alt=\"Inline settings vs full-screen settings\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Inline settings vs full-screen settings\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI explored ways to differentiate project-level and user-level settings, and how multiple projects should be represented in the sidebar.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 !my-0 md:col-span-2\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\"\n      src={settingsSidebarsImage}\n      alt=\"Settings sidebar exploration\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Settings sidebar exploration\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 !my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\"\n      src={nestedProjectsImage}\n      alt=\"Nested projects\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Nested projects\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={switcherNewProjectImage}\n    alt=\"Switcher new project\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Adding a new project from the switcher\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Refining Design\n\nI refined the settings UI to balance usability, visual consistency, and technical constraints. To align with business goals, less critical settings were trimmed or hidden, allowing us to prioritize core functionality for a faster, more reliable launch.

Inspired by platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner, the goal was to create a clear, efficient search experience that supports users in finding flight deals and seamlessly redirects them to third-party booking sites.\n\n## The Problem\n\n- Confusing pricing structures (e.g., hidden baggage or seat fees).\n- Overwhelming flight comparison interfaces.\n- Pressure from countdown timers and \"only 2 seats left!\" tactics.\n- Hidden information (does flight have wi-fi etc).\n- Inflexible booking tools for open-ended travel.\n- Visa or travel restriction info not surfaced during booking.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Keep UI simple and easy to use.\n- Avoid sales pressure tactics.\n- Show price up front.\n- Have options to show flights for power users.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nTo better understand user needs and pain points, I developed three user personas based on distinct travel behaviors. While these were created using assumed data for this case study, in a real-world scenario, they would be informed by qualitative and quantitative user research.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={notionPersonasImage}\n    alt=\"Storing personas in Notion\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>User personas in Notion\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={userPersonasImage}\n      alt=\"Inside each persona\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Each persona\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWith the personas in place, I created a user flow to visualise the key steps users take from landing on the site to selecting a deal and being redirected to a third-party booking platform.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={userFlowImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>User flow\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI then mapped each persona's journey through the search and booking process to identify key frustrations, motivations, and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={saraJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Sara's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={marcusJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Marcus's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={leoJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Leo's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nA common theme between the users is that the fights tend to have hidden baggage or seat fees so I will try to add transparent pricing or tooltips to reveal the prices.\n\n### Typography\n\nDM Sans has a simple, geometric, and modern style that feels fresh and approachable—perfect for flight deals aggregator where it has a mix of users. It has a nice balance between being professional and welcoming, which helps build trust without feeling too corporate or cold.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={dmSansImage}\n      alt=\"Typography choice\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>From search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Exploring Designs\n\nTo begin visualising the UI, I created wireframes in Whimsical.\n\n\u003Ciframe\n  class=\"aspect-video w-full\"\n  style=\"border:none\"\n  width=\"1280\"\n  height=\"640\"\n  src=\"https://whimsical.com/embed/VvcyisSJE6Cz18RwmH4GLG\"\n>\u003C/iframe>\n\nThese wireframes were kept simple, emphasising layout. The goal at this stage was to quickly try out layouts for key elements such as the search bar, filters, and flight results, without getting distracted by styling details. Inspired by established platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner. These early wireframes helped identify opportunities to improve usability and guided the next phase of iterative design.\n\n### Refining Designs\n\nSince search is the most important feature of a flight deals site, I made it more prominent by visually separating it from the background, breaking it out of the hero and adding a shadow for emphasis.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={ogSearchImage}\n      alt=\"Original search design\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Original search design\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nReviewing the design:\n\n- The search look cluttered due to the spacing between inputs\n- The return date toggle appeared visually off\n- The to/from switch icon resembled a refresh symbol\n\nI made some tweaks with the above feedback in mind. As this is a self-initiated project, I haven't done formal user testing, but my decisions are based on usability best practices.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={newSearchImage}\n      alt=\"Tweaked search design\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Tweaked search design\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTo make the search more intuitive, I added location-based auto-suggestions using the user's IP address so users can quickly select a location. Additionally, I included recent searches to support power users with faster access to frequently used locations. While populating the from destination with popular destinations for people unsure where to go.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={fromSearchImage}\n      alt=\"From search dropdown\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>From search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={toSearchImage}\n      alt=\"To search dropdown\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>To search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI structured the exploration flight cards with the F-shaped scanning pattern in mind, placing key details where users' eyes naturally land first.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={explorationflightCardImage}\n      alt=\"Flight card\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Exploration flight cards\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI've kept the search minimal on the results page to maximize space for flight listings, but it will expand when clicked.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\" src={resultsImage} alt=\"Results card\" />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Flight results with the search minimised\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nDue to the UI being quite busy on these results pages I added a button to reveal more details for the flights to highlight any hidden costs, such as seat selection fees or checked baggage charges.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={moreDetailsImage}\n      alt=\"Flight card with expanded detail view\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>More details for flights\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nAlthough this self-initiated case study didn't involve live user testing, I based design decisions on heuristics, competitor patterns (like Kayak and Skyscanner), and common usability principles.\n\nSee the full mockups below:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"relative left-0 h-224 w-full\">\n  \u003Ciframe\n    class=\"aspect-video\"\n    src=\"https://www.sketch.com/embed/s/6d9d8d80-49fb-494b-93f6-49abdc8e0fe5\"\n    style=\"top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;\"\n    allowfullscreen\n  >\u003C/iframe>\n\u003C/div>","src/work/air-hustle.mdx",[62],"@images/splendid-flights@2x.png","af6ef6711341f43f"]
