The goal was to modernise the flow,\nintegrate it into the new design system, and ensure it supported complex\ncampaign logic. I worked closely with engineers to polish the UI, maintain\nconsistency, and test functionality.\n\n## The Problem\n\n- Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key customer at\n  risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered quickly.\n- The challenge was to migrate this functionality quickly from the legacy\n  platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to better fit the\n  new campaign builder model.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing experience.\n- Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the feature into\n  the new design system and component patterns..\n- Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign logic and\n  ensure a reliable user experience.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nResearched how similar tools (like Mailchimp, Customer.io, and Braze) handled\nA/B testing, especially how they explained traffic split, metrics, and variant\nselection.\n\n### Exploring designs\n\nShared early mockups internally to validate direction and ensure feasibility\nunder technical constraints and tight timelines.\n\n### Refining design\n\nWorked closely with product and engineering to scope a realistic MVP version\nthat covered core functionality but allowed for future iteration.\n\nSince it was quite difficult to tell the variants apart, I added a coloured highlight to differentiate them based on their status.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={manualTestImage}\n    alt=\"Manual test\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Manual test\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={pickAWinnerImage}\n    alt=\"Pick a winner\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Pick a winner\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## What I learned\n\nShipping A/B testing for Vero 2.0, helped accelerated go-to-market and contributed to user retention.","src/work/ab-testing.mdx",[25],"@images/ab-testing@2x.png","e95a8fa9cbe66fac",true,"air-hustle",{"id":28,"data":30,"body":38,"filePath":39,"assetImports":40,"digest":42,"deferredRender":27},{"company":31,"title":32,"description":33,"headline":33,"role":34,"slug":28,"cover":35,"order":36,"gradient":37,"alignment":21},"Self-initiated","Air Hustle","Designing the experience for a flight deals aggregator","Led UX, Led UI","__ASTRO_IMAGE_@images/splendid-flights@2x.png",1,"tertiary","import { Image } from \"astro:assets\";\n\nimport CaseStudyCallout from \"../components/CaseStudyCallout.astro\";\nimport notionPersonasImage from \"@images/notion-personas@2x.png\";\nimport userPersonasImage from \"@images/user-personas@2x.png\";\nimport saraJourneyImage from \"@images/sara-journey@2x.png\";\nimport marcusJourneyImage from \"@images/marcus-journey@2x.png\";\nimport leoJourneyImage from \"@images/leo-journey@2x.png\";\nimport userFlowImage from \"@images/user-flow@2x.png\";\nimport dmSansImage from \"@images/dm-sans@2x.png\";\nimport ogSearchImage from \"@images/og-search@2x.png\";\nimport newSearchImage from \"@images/new-search@2x.png\";\nimport fromSearchImage from \"@images/from-search@2x.png\";\nimport toSearchImage from \"@images/to-search@2x.png\";\nimport explorationflightCardImage from \"@images/flight-card@2x.png\";\nimport resultsImage from \"@images/results@2x.png\";\nimport moreDetailsImage from \"@images/more-details@2x.png\";\n\n## Overview\n\nSelf-initiated UI case study focuses on designing the user flow and interface for a flight deals aggregator site. Inspired by platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner, the goal was to create a clear, efficient search experience that supports users in finding flight deals and seamlessly redirects them to third-party booking sites.\n\n## The Problem\n\nFor this self-initiated case study, I explored user frustrations with a travel deals aggregator site. Through personal experience and a review of existing platforms, I uncovered common friction points travelers face when searching for and booking flights on aggregator platforms.\n\n### Identified pain points\n\n- Confusing pricing structures (eg hidden baggage or seat fees).\n- Overwhelming flight comparison interfaces.\n- Pressure from countdown timers and \"only 2 seats left!\" tactics.\n- Hidden information (does flight have wi-fi etc).\n- Inflexible booking tools for open-ended travel.\n- Visa or travel restriction info not surfaced during booking.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Keep UI simple and easy to use.\n- Avoid sales pressure tactics.\n- Show price up front.\n- Have options to show flights for power users.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nTo better understand user needs and pain points, I developed three user personas based on distinct travel behaviors. While these were created using assumed data for this case study, in a real-world scenario, they would be informed by qualitative and quantitative user research.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={notionPersonasImage}\n    alt=\"Storing personas in Notion\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>User personas in Notion\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={userPersonasImage}\n      alt=\"Inside each persona\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Each persona\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWith the personas in place, I created a user flow to visualise the key steps users take from landing on the site to selecting a deal and being redirected to a third-party booking platform.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={userFlowImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>User flow\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI then mapped each persona's journey through the search and booking process to identify key frustrations, motivations, and opportunities for improvement.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={saraJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Sara's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={marcusJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Marcus's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={leoJourneyImage}\n      alt=\"Repacking wireframes\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Leo's journey map\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nA common theme between the users is that the fights tend to have hidden baggage or seat fees so I will try to add transparent pricing or tooltips to reveal the prices.\n\n### Typography\n\nDM Sans has a simple, geometric, and modern style that feels fresh and approachableâ€”perfect for flight deals aggregator where it has a mix of users. It has a nice balance between being professional and welcoming, which helps build trust without feeling too corporate or cold.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={dmSansImage}\n      alt=\"Typography choice\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>From search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Exploring Designs\n\nTo begin visualising the UI, I created wireframes in Whimsical.\n\n\u003Ciframe\n  class=\"aspect-video w-full\"\n  style=\"border:none\"\n  width=\"1280\"\n  height=\"640\"\n  src=\"https://whimsical.com/embed/VvcyisSJE6Cz18RwmH4GLG\"\n>\u003C/iframe>\n\nThese wireframes were kept simple, emphasising layout. The goal at this stage was to quickly try out layouts for key elements such as the search bar, filters, and flight results, without getting distracted by styling details. Inspired by established platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner. These early wireframes helped identify opportunities to improve usability and guided the next phase of iterative design.\n\n### Refining Designs\n\nSince search is the most important feature of a flight deals site, I made it more prominent by visually separating it from the background, breaking it out of the hero and adding a shadow for emphasis.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={ogSearchImage}\n      alt=\"Original search design\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Original search design\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nReviewing the design:\n\n- The search look cluttered due to the spacing between inputs\n- The return date toggle appeared visually off\n- The to/from switch icon resembled a refresh symbol\n\nI made some tweaks with the above feedback in mind. As this is a self-initiated project, I haven't done formal user testing, but my decisions are based on usability best practices.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={newSearchImage}\n      alt=\"Tweaked search design\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Tweaked search design\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTo make the search more intuitive, I added location-based auto-suggestions using the user's IP address so users can quickly select a location. Additionally, I included recent searches to support power users with faster access to frequently used locations. While populating the from destination with popular destinations for people unsure where to go.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={fromSearchImage}\n      alt=\"From search dropdown\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>From search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={toSearchImage}\n      alt=\"To search dropdown\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>To search suggestions\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI structured the exploration flight cards with the F-shaped scanning pattern in mind, placing key details where users' eyes naturally land first.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={explorationflightCardImage}\n      alt=\"Flight card\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Exploration flight cards\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI've kept the search minimal on the results page to maximize space for flight listings, but it will expand when clicked.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\" src={resultsImage} alt=\"Results card\" />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Flight results with the search minimised\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nDue to the UI being quite busy on these results pages I added a button to reveal more details for the flights to highlight any hidden costs, such as seat selection fees or checked baggage charges.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"!m-0 drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={moreDetailsImage}\n      alt=\"Flight card with expanded detail view\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>More details for flights\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nAlthough this self-initiated case study didn't involve live user testing, I based design decisions on heuristics, competitor patterns (like Kayak and Skyscanner), and common usability principles.\n\nSee the full mockups below:\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"relative left-0 h-224 w-full\">\n  \u003Ciframe\n    class=\"aspect-video\"\n    src=\"https://www.sketch.com/embed/s/6d9d8d80-49fb-494b-93f6-49abdc8e0fe5\"\n    style=\"top: 0;

Users had trouble managing accounts, projects, and preferences without getting lost. I led the redesign of the entire settings system to make it easier to use, more consistent, and ready to scale.\n\n## The Problem\n\nTo understand the key challenges, I collaborated with the Head of Product, who provided product goals and insights gathered from the customer success teams and user feedback.\n\n### Pain Points\n\n- The settings section was fragmented, making it hard to manage projects,\n  accounts, and user preferences.\n- There was no clear distinction between user-level\n  and project-level settings, causing confusion around which settings affected what.\n- As more settings from Vero 1.0 are integrated into Vero 2.0, the lack of hierarchical\n  clarity is becoming increasingly problematic.\n- Users can't customise their user profile by adding an image.\n- The concept of an organisation layer introduces a new level of complexity, with\n  no existing structure to support organisation-specific settings.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Organize all settings into a clear, logical structure.\n- Improve navigation and clarity.\n- Use consistent design patterns for every setting type.\n- Build a scalable system for future features.\n\n## Process\n\n### Research\n\nWe collaborated closely with the Customer Support and Success teams to surface insights from real user conversations. Their frontline experience helped us identify recurring pain points and edge cases that might not have been obvious. The Head of Product synthesised this feedback in a shared Notion workspace, which served as a central reference throughout the redesign.\n\nThe Head of Product conducted a comprehensive audit of all existing settings across user roles and project types. This was also to decide which settings to port over from the Vero 1.0 to Vero 2.0 and which to deprecate.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={featureAuditImage}\n    alt=\"Feature audit\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Feature comparistion table of the two products\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nDue to time and resource constraints, I took a Lean UX approachâ€”quickly creating\nlightweight user personas based on known user behaviors and context.

I also explored key interaction states, including different layouts and behaviours for modals and dropdowns, to ensure consistency and usability across various settings types.\n\n- **Modal vs inline for profile settings:** Should profiles open in a modal for quick access, or be\n  embedded inline within the settings view?\n- **Inline vs full-screen views:** Should settings open up full-screen so the new settings could also be used in Vero 1.0?\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={accountProfileModalTypeImage}\n    alt=\"Account profile modal type\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>\n    Srolling vs tabbed navigation in the account & profile modal\n  \u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={inlineFullScreenImage}\n    alt=\"Inline settings vs full-screen settings\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Inline settings vs full-screen settings\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nI explored ways to differentiate project-level and user-level settings, and how\nmultiple projects should be represented in the sidebar.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 !my-0 md:col-span-2\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\"\n      src={settingsSidebarsImage}\n      alt=\"Settings sidebar exploration\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Settings sidebar exploration\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 !my-0\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\"\n      src={nestedProjectsImage}\n      alt=\"Nested projects\"\n    />\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Nested projects\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\nI shared these mockups internally to gather feedback early. This collaborative process helped me evaluate trade-offs due to balancing business goals and technical constraints.\n\n### Concepts Not Pursued\n\nTo align with business goals, some features were moved to phase 2, allowing us to prioritise core features for a faster launch. One of these decisions included removing the 'add new project' feature, enabling us to deliver a leaner MVP within the 8-week timeframe.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003CImage\n    class=\"rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50\"\n    src={switcherNewProjectImage}\n    alt=\"Switcher new project\"\n  />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Adding a new project from the switcher\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Refining Design\n\nI refined the mockups to balance usability, visual consistency, and technical constraints. During implementation once the bulk of the engineering work was done I jumped in to the code to do some design polish like refining spacing to ensure a more consistent and scalable experience.\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10\">\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\">\n      \u003CImage\n        class=\"!my-0 rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl\"\n        src={dataFeedsImage}\n        alt=\"Data feeds\"\n      />\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Data feeds\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n  \u003Cfigure class=\"col-span-1 md:col-span-2\">\n    \u003Cdiv class=\"overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50\">\n      \u003CImage\n        class=\"!my-0 rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl\"\n        src={teamMembersImage}\n        alt=\"Team members\"\n      />\n    \u003C/div>\n    \u003Cfigcaption>Team members\u003C/figcaption>\n  \u003C/figure>\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Release and iterate\n\nPost-release feedback revealed that the sidebar in the settings section felt visually disconnected from the rest of the appâ€”due to differences in width and styling compared to the non-settings sidebar. To address this, I led a refinement of the layout by standardising the width and\naligning the styles of the settings sidebar to improve visual consistency.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cdiv class=\"rounded-4xl overflow-hidden bg-cyan-50\">\n    \u003CImage\n      class=\"drop-shadow-xl\"\n      src={settingsSidebarTweaksImage}\n      alt=\"Settings sidebar tweaks\"\n    />\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Settings sidebar tweaks post-launch\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## What I learned\n\nAs a result of relasing the redesign settings, support requests related to user and project settings decreased, contributing to less customer frustration.","src/work/settings.mdx",[66],"@images/settings@2x.png","7edfd893feb45205"]
