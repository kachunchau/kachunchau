    <p class="gamma">I was part of the team that redesigned the base mobile templates using existing data for bluCommerce which you can see here - http://www.blubolt.com/mobile/. I was the main designer for this project and as a team we went through research, wireframes, prototypes and then hi-fidelity mockups. Here are some live examples using the templates - <a href="https://www.teapigs.co.uk/m">https://www.teapigs.co.uk/m</a>, http://mi-pac.com/m and <a href="https://www.hush-uk.com/m">https://www.hush-uk.com/m</a>.</p>
