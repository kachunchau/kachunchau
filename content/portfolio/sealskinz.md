## Overview

Sealskinz's old site was hard to navigate and difficult to traverse. At blubolt I was tasked to redesign their entire ecommerce site.

### Goals and objectives

* Increase conversions
* Easier to navigate
* Incorporate more lifestyle imagery
* More emphasis to their category pages
* More content on product pages so customers can get immersed in the products

Sealskinz are a preimium brand and they wanted their new design to reflect the quality of their products. This was done by using ample white space and a dark colour palette to reflect luxury.

An internal component library was created in Sketch was ease of maintainability and scability in the future.
