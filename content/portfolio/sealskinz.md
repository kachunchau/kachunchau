## Overview

Sealskinz's old site was cluttered, hard to navigate and visually very boring in comparision to their high priced products. At blubolt I was tasked to redesign their entire ecommerce site.

### Goals and objectives

* Increase conversions
* Easier to navigate
* Incorporate more lifestyle imagery
* More emphasis to their category pages
* More content on product pages so customers can get immersed in the products

Sealskinz are a preimium brand and they wanted their new design to reflect the quality of their products. This was done by using ample white space to support their imagery and a dark colour palette to show luxury.
