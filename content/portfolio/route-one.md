## Overview

A complete redesign at blubolt due to Route One's ever expanding warehousing they needed a UX to reflect the customer facing side.

### Goals and objectives

* Easy to navigate
* Better showcase of their products
* Better conversions

A sans serif and a serif were used to represent their new site. Roboto Condensed was used to show they are strong and indepdent whereas the serif was used sparingly to hint at their elegance.

A grid layout lets their product imagery shine and keeps it clean.

Due to how important the product pages are for ecommerce stores I had to make sure the main call to action has the highest contrast. In this case this is the add to basket button.
