## Overview

A complete redesign at blubolt due to Route One's ever expanding warehousing they needed a UX to reflect the customer facing side.

### Goals and objectives
* Easy to navigate
* Better showcase of their products
* Better conversions

Route One is a strong and dependable brand with a hint of elegance. To evoke this personality through the typography I used a combination of a sans-serif and a serif font.

A grid layout lets their product imagery shine and keeps it clean.

Due to how important the product pages are for ecommerce stores I had to make sure the main call to action has the highest contrast. In this case this is the add to basket button.
