## Problem

During my time at blubolt I was tasked to design one of their new features for bluCommerce. Persistent Basket allows you to sync your basket across devices on bluCommerce sites enabling shoppers to shop everywhere.</p>

### Goals and objectives

* Define the best user journey
* Make sure a MVP is shippable

I worked with the product owner on user journeys to see how users will traverse this action. After various feedback stages we progressed to hi-fidelity mockups with different iterations depending on the basket content.

{{< img src="/images/Persistent-Basket-05.jpg" alt="Empty basket with no saved items" >}}

{{< img src="/images/Persistent-Basket-06.jpg" alt="Basket with saved items" >}}

The UI was based on the base templates but each client will have their own custom styling. I explored separate desktop and mobile versions.
