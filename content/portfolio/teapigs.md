## Overview

Teapigs are one of blubolt's oldest clients and we were asked to redesign their ecommerce store.

Their old site didn't reflect the quality of their products and the store show confidence when buying.

### Goals and objectives

* Better conversion on product pages
* Buy with confidence

I used a combination of thick borders and their whimsical artwork to portray them as friendly and helpful. To make sure the site is easy to navigate the top links were condensed to only a few supported with a full screen search overlay.

The end result is a site that represented their brand a lot better.
