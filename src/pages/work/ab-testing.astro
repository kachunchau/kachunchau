          <p class="mb-0">
            As part of the Vero 2.0 merge, I led the redesign of A/B testing for
            newsletter-style campaigns. The goal was to evaluate message
            variants while ensuring we could rapidly deliver a working feature
            to prevent customer churn. This work required balancing urgency with
            thoughtful design, and ensuring parity with core functionality from
            the legacy platform—while still improving usability.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key
            customer at risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered
            quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The challenge was to migrate this functionality quickly from the
            legacy platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to
            better fit the new campaign builder model.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing
            experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the
            feature into the new design system and component patterns..
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign
            logic and ensure a reliable user experience.
          </li>
          <li>Build a scalable system for future features.</li>

          Process
        </h2>

        <h3>Research</h3>

        <p>
          Benchmarked how similar tools (like Mailchimp, Customer.io, and Braze)
          handled A/B testing, especially how they explained traffic split,
          metrics, and variant selection.
        </p>

        <h3>Exploring designs</h3>

        <p>
          Shared early mockups with PMs, engineers, and the customer success
          team to validate direction and ensure feasibility under tight
          timelines.
        </p>

        <h3>Refining design</h3>

        <p>
          Worked closely with product and engineering to scope a realistic MVP
          version that covered core functionality but allowed for future
          iteration.
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Release and iterate</h2>

      <p>
        After release, we received feedback that the sidebar in the settings
        section felt visually disconnected from the rest of the app—due to
        differences in width and styling compared to the non-settings sidebar.
      </p>
      <p>
        We responded by standardising the layout and aligning the styles of
        the settings sidebar to improve visual consistency.
