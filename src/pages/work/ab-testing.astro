      description="I designed the A/B testing experience for Vero 2.0, bringing back a critical feature from the legacy platform. The goal was to modernise the flow, integrate it into the new design system, and ensure it supported complex campaign logic. I worked closely with engineers to polish the UI, maintain consistency, and test functionality."
    />

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key customer
        at risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        The challenge was to migrate this functionality quickly from the legacy
        platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to better fit
        the new campaign builder model.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing
        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the feature
        into the new design system and component patterns..
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign logic
        and ensure a reliable user experience.

      Process
    </h2>

    <h3>Research</h3>

    <p>
      Benchmarked how similar tools (like Mailchimp, Customer.io, and Braze)
      handled A/B testing, especially how they explained traffic split, metrics,
      and variant selection.
    </p>

    <h3>Exploring designs</h3>

    <p>
      Shared early mockups internally to validate direction and ensure
      feasibility under technical constraints and tight timelines.
    </p>

    <h3>Refining design</h3>

    <p>
      Worked closely with product and engineering to scope a realistic MVP
      version that covered core functionality but allowed for future iteration.
    </p>

    <!-- <h2>Release and iterate</h2>

  <p>
    After release, we received feedback that the sidebar in the settings
    section felt visually disconnected from the rest of the appâ€”due to
    differences in width and styling compared to the non-settings sidebar.
  </p>
  <p>
    We responded by standardising the layout and aligning the styles of
    the settings sidebar to improve visual consistency.
