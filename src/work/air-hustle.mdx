## Overview

Self-initiated UI case study focuses on designing the user flow and interface for a flight deals aggregator site. Inspired by platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner, the goal was to create a clear, efficient search experience that supports users in finding flight deals and seamlessly redirects them to third-party booking sites.

## The Problem

- Confusing pricing structures (e.g., hidden baggage or seat fees).
- Overwhelming flight comparison interfaces.
- Pressure from countdown timers and "only 2 seats left!" tactics.
- Hidden information (does flight have wi-fi etc).
- Inflexible booking tools for open-ended travel.
- Visa or travel restriction info not surfaced during booking.

## Goals

- Keep UI simple and easy to use.
- Avoid sales pressure tactics.
- Show price up front.
- Have options to show flights for power users.

## Process

### Research

To better understand user needs and pain points, I developed three user personas based on distinct travel behaviors. While these were created using assumed data for this case study, in a real-world scenario, they would be informed by qualitative and quantitative user research.

<figure>
  <Image
    class="rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50"
    src={notionPersonasImage}
    alt="Storing personas in Notion"
  />
  <figcaption>User personas in Notion</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="drop-shadow-xl"
      src={userPersonasImage}
      alt="Inside each persona"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Each persona</figcaption>
</figure>

With the personas in place, I created a user flow to visualise the key steps users take from landing on the site to selecting a deal and being redirected to a third-party booking platform.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={userFlowImage}
      alt="Repacking wireframes"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>User flow</figcaption>
</figure>

I then mapped each persona's journey through the search and booking process to identify key frustrations, motivations, and opportunities for improvement.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={saraJourneyImage}
      alt="Repacking wireframes"
    />
  </div>

  <figcaption>Sara's journey map</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={marcusJourneyImage}
      alt="Repacking wireframes"
    />
  </div>

  <figcaption>Marcus's journey map</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={leoJourneyImage}
      alt="Repacking wireframes"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Leo's journey map</figcaption>
</figure>

A common theme between the users is that the fights tend to have hidden baggage or seat fees so I will try to add transparent pricing or tooltips to reveal the prices.

### Typography

DM Sans has a simple, geometric, and modern style that feels fresh and approachableâ€”perfect for flight deals aggregator where it has a mix of users. It has a nice balance between being professional and welcoming, which helps build trust without feeling too corporate or cold.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={dmSansImage}
      alt="Typography choice"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>From search suggestions</figcaption>
</figure>

### Exploring Designs

To begin visualising the UI, I created wireframes in Whimsical.

<iframe
  class="aspect-video w-full"
  style="border:none"
  width="1280"
  height="640"
  src="https://whimsical.com/embed/VvcyisSJE6Cz18RwmH4GLG"
></iframe>

These wireframes were kept simple, emphasising layout. The goal at this stage was to quickly try out layouts for key elements such as the search bar, filters, and flight results, without getting distracted by styling details. Inspired by established platforms like Kayak and Skyscanner. These early wireframes helped identify opportunities to improve usability and guided the next phase of iterative design.

### Refining Designs

Since search is the most important feature of a flight deals site, I made it more prominent by visually separating it from the background, breaking it out of the hero and adding a shadow for emphasis.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={ogSearchImage}
      alt="Original search design"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Original search design</figcaption>
</figure>

Reviewing the design:

- The search look cluttered due to the spacing between inputs
- The return date toggle appeared visually off
- The to/from switch icon resembled a refresh symbol

I made some tweaks with the above feedback in mind. As this is a self-initiated project, I haven't done formal user testing, but my decisions are based on usability best practices.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={newSearchImage}
      alt="Tweaked search design"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Tweaked search design</figcaption>
</figure>

To make the search more intuitive, I added location-based auto-suggestions using the user's IP address so users can quickly select a location. Additionally, I included recent searches to support power users with faster access to frequently used locations. While populating the from destination with popular destinations for people unsure where to go.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={fromSearchImage}
      alt="From search dropdown"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>From search suggestions</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={toSearchImage}
      alt="To search dropdown"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>To search suggestions</figcaption>
</figure>

I structured the exploration flight cards with the F-shaped scanning pattern in mind, placing key details where users' eyes naturally land first.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={explorationflightCardImage}
      alt="Flight card"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Exploration flight cards</figcaption>
</figure>

I've kept the search minimal on the results page to maximize space for flight listings, but it will expand when clicked.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl" src={resultsImage} alt="Results card" />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Flight results with the search minimised</figcaption>
</figure>

Due to the UI being quite busy on these results pages I added a button to reveal more details for the flights to highlight any hidden costs, such as seat selection fees or checked baggage charges.

<figure>
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-4xl bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="!m-0 drop-shadow-xl"
      src={moreDetailsImage}
      alt="Flight card with expanded detail view"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>More details for flights</figcaption>
</figure>

Although this self-initiated case study didn't involve live user testing, I based design decisions on heuristics, competitor patterns (like Kayak and Skyscanner), and common usability principles.
