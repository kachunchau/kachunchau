## Overview

A 6 weeks design of adding A/B Testing to newsletter-style campaigns to Vero 2.0. I led the design to deliver a simple, scalable solution within a team of 5 â€” shipping was critical to retain a high-value customer.

Using Sketch for design and React/Ember for development, we aimed to modernise the flow, integrate it into the new design system, and ensure it supported complex campaign logic.

### Impact

Shipping A/B Testing, helped accelerate Vero's go-to-market strategy, ticks of a feature to be migrated over to the new product and most importantly prevented a big customer from churning.

## The Problem

- Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key customer at
  risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered quickly.
- The challenge was to migrate this functionality quickly from the legacy
  platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to better fit the
  new campaign builder model.

## Goals

- Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing experience.
- Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the feature into
  the new design system and component patterns..
- Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign logic and
  ensure a reliable user experience.

## Process

### Research

Researched how similar tools (like Mailchimp, Customer.io, and Braze) handled
A/B testing, especially how they explained traffic split, metrics, and variant
selection.

### Exploring designs

Shared early mockups internally to validate direction and ensure feasibility
under technical constraints and tight timelines.

### Refining design

Worked closely with product and engineering to scope a realistic MVP version
that covered core functionality but allowed for future iteration.

Since it was quite difficult to tell the variants apart, I added a coloured highlight to differentiate them based on their status.
