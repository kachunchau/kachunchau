## Overview

A 6 weeks sprint of adding A/B Testing to newsletter-style campaigns to Vero 2.0. I led the design to deliver a simple, scalable solution within a team of 5 (Head of Product, Product Designer, and 3 Engineers) — shipping was critical to retain a high-value customer.

Using Sketch for design and React/Ember for development, we aimed to modernise the flow, integrate it into the new design system, and ensure it supported complex campaign logic.

### Impact

Shipping A/B Testing, helped accelerate Vero's go-to-market strategy, ticks of a feature to be migrated over to the new product and most importantly prevented a big customer from churning.

## The Problem

- Vero 2.0 initially launched without A/B testing, putting a key customer at
  risk of churning if the feature wasn't delivered quickly.
- The challenge was to **migrate this feature quickly** from the legacy
  platform to Vero 2.0 while also improving the overall UX to better fit the
  new campaign builder model.

## Goals

- Independently design the UI and UX for a modernised A/B testing experience.
- Drawing inspiration from the legacy platform while fitting the feature into
  the new design system and component patterns..
- Identify and account for edge cases to support complex campaign logic and
  ensure a reliable user experience.

## Process

### Research

Due to time constraints, I quickly researched how comparable platforms — Mailchimp, Drip, Campaign Monitor, and Braze handle A/B testing to identify common patterns and potential gaps. A few common insights emerged:

- A/B testing features are often hidden or buried in advanced settings, making them easy to overlook or use incorrectly.
- No **auto-pick winner option** — the user must manually select a winner, and if they forget, it can delay the final send.
- Some platforms only support testing two variants, limiting experimentation flexibility.

This quick research helped shape the foundation of the design.

### Exploring designs

I shared early mockups internally to validate direction and ensure feasibility
under technical constraints and tight timelines. During this process, I realised that placing all variants within the same message panel created significant visual clutter, making it difficult to distinguish between variants once their 10.

    <Image class="drop-shadow-xl" src={variantsImage} alt="Variants" />
  </div>

</figure>

To mitigate the issue, I placed each variant in its own panel and added coloured highlights to indicate the status of the variant.

## Release and Iterate

We shipped the redesigned A/B testing feature within weeks, retaining the customer who had flagged it as a deal-breaker.

## What I learned

This project reinforced the value of designing lean but scalable solutions under pressure. We shipped fast to retain a high-value customer and unlock migration to the new platform—taking another step toward merging the 2 products into 1. It taught me how to prioritise, make pragmatic design decisions, and deliver a usable experience within tight time and resource constraints while still leaving room for future improvement.
