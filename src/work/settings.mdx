<CaseStudyCallout description="In Vero 2.0, the settings experience was confusing and spread out. Users had trouble managing accounts, projects, and preferences without getting lost. I led the redesign of the entire settings system to make it easier to use, more consistent, and ready to scale." />

## The Problem

To understand the key challenges, I collaborated with the Head of Product, who provided problem statements grounded in strategic product goals and insights gathered from internal teams and user feedback channels. These formed the foundation for my design exploration and decision-making.

### Identified Problems

- The settings section was fragmented, making it hard to manage projects, accounts, and user preferences.
- There was no clear distinction between user-level and project-level settings, causing confusion around which settings affected what.
- As more settings from Vero 1.0 are integrated into Vero 2.0, the lack of hierarchical clarity is becoming increasingly problematic.
- Users can't customise their user profile by adding an image.
- There was no clear structure or consistent design.
- The concept of an organisation layer introduces a new level of complexity, with no existing structure to support organisation-specific settings.

## Goals

- Organize all settings into a clear, logical structure.
- Improve navigation and clarity.
- Use consistent design patterns for every setting type.
- Build a scalable system for future features.

## Process

### Research

Collaborated with the Head of Product to conduct a comprehensive audit of all existing settings across user roles and project types. This was also to decide which settings to port over from the Vero 1.0 to Vero 2.0 and which to deprecate.

Due to time and resource constraints, I took a Lean UX approach—quickly creating lightweight personas based on known user behaviors and context. This allowed for fast, informed design decisions without delaying the process.

{(() => {
const userPersonas = [
{
name: "Emily",
age: 29,
occupation: "Product Manager",
goal: "Quickly find and adjust both personal and project settings to manage her team efficiently.",
painPoint: "Gets confused when settings for different scopes (user vs. project) are mixed together without clear separation.",
behaviour: "Frequently switches between projects, values a clean, organized interface."
},
{
name: "David",
age: 34,
occupation: "Developer",
goal: "Access technical settings swiftly without distractions or extra clicks..",
painPoint: "Finds overly complex or cluttered settings frustrating and time-consuming.",
behaviour: "Uses settings sparingly but expects them to be precise and streamlined."
},
{
name: "Nina",
age: 24,
occupation: "Marketing Analyst",
goal: "Navigate and update her profile and notification preferences without confusion.",
painPoint: "Struggles with unclear terminology or ambiguous labels in the settings interface.",
behaviour: "Uses settings occasionally, prefers intuitive UI that requires little guidance."
}
];

const displayNames = {
painPoint: "Pain Points",
};

return (

<div className=" grid gap-8 md:gap-10 max-w-3xl md:mx-16">
  {userPersonas.map((persona, index) => (
    <div className="bg-slate-50 ring-slate-100 ring-1 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl" key={index}>
      <div className="font-semibold px-4 py-2">{persona.name}</div>
      {Object.entries(persona).map(
        ([key, value]) =>
          key !== "name" && (
            <div className="grid even:bg-white grid-cols-5" key={key}>
              <span className="px-4 col-span-2 py-2 capitalize font-medium">{displayNames[key] || key}: </span>
              <span className="col-span-3 px-4 py-2">{value}</span>
            </div>
          ),
      )}
    </div>

))}

</div>
); })()}

To guide our design approach, we also reviewed how tools in adjacent industries—such as Netlify and Vercel—organised their settings, drawing inspiration from proven patterns.

### Exploring Designs

We have a Sketch library our our components and I explored different mid to hi-fidelity mockups—testing different ways to group and present the settings sidebar. I shared these iterations regularly internally to gather feedback early. This collaborative process helped me evaluate trade-offs due to balancing business goals or technical constraints.

- **Modal vs inline for profile settings:** Should profiles open in a modal for quick access, or be embedded inline within the settings view?
- **Inline vs full-screen views:** Should settings open up full-screen so the new settings could also be used in Vero 1.0?

I explored ways to differentiate project-level and user-level settings, and how multiple projects should be represented in the sidebar.

### Refining Design

I refined the settings UI to balance usability, visual consistency, and technical constraints. To align with business goals, less critical settings were trimmed or hidden, allowing us to prioritize core functionality for a faster, more reliable launch. During implementation, I made incremental improvements—like refining spacing and navigation groupings—to ensure a more consistent and scalable experience.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10">
  <figure class="col-span-1 !my-0">
    <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50">

        class="rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl"
        src={dataFeedsImage}
        alt="Data feeds"
      />

        src={teamMembersImage}
        alt="Team members"
      />
    </div>

</div>

## Release and iterate

Post-release feedback revealed that the sidebar in the settings section felt visually disconnected from the rest of the app—due to differences in width and styling compared to the non-settings sidebar. To address this, I led a refinement of the layout by standardising the width and aligning the styles of the settings sidebar to improve visual consistency.
