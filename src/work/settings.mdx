## Overview

In Vero 2.0, the settings experience was confusing and spread out. Users had trouble managing accounts, projects, and preferences without getting lost. I led the redesign of the entire settings system to make it easier to use, more consistent, and ready to scale.

## The Problem

To understand the key challenges, I collaborated with the Head of Product, who provided product goals and insights gathered from the customer success teams and user feedback.

### Pain Points

- The settings section was fragmented, making it hard to manage projects,
  accounts, and user preferences.
- There was no clear distinction between user-level
  and project-level settings, causing confusion around which settings affected what.
- As more settings from Vero 1.0 are integrated into Vero 2.0, the lack of hierarchical
  clarity is becoming increasingly problematic.
- Users can't customise their user profile by adding an image.
- The concept of an organisation layer introduces a new level of complexity, with
  no existing structure to support organisation-specific settings.

## Goals

- Organize all settings into a clear, logical structure.
- Improve navigation and clarity.
- Use consistent design patterns for every setting type.
- Build a scalable system for future features.

## Process

### Research

We collaborated closely with the Customer Support and Success teams to surface insights from real user conversations. Their frontline experience helped us identify recurring pain points and edge cases that might not have been obvious. The Head of Product synthesised this feedback in a shared Notion workspace, which served as a central reference throughout the redesign.

The Head of Product conducted a comprehensive audit of all existing settings across user roles and project types. This was also to decide which settings to port over from the Vero 1.0 to Vero 2.0 and which to deprecate.

Due to time and resource constraints, I took a Lean UX approach—quickly creating
lightweight user personas based on known user behaviors and context. This allowed for
fast, informed design decisions without delaying the process.

### Competitive analysis

To guide our design approach, we also reviewed how tools in adjacent
industries—such as Netlify and Vercel—organised their settings, drawing
inspiration from proven patterns.

  <figure class="!my-0">

### Exploring Designs

Having a Sketch component library allowed me to quickly explore mid to high-fidelity mockups, testing different ways to group and present the settings sidebar. I also explored key interaction states, including different layouts and behaviours for modals and dropdowns, to ensure consistency and usability across various settings types.

- **Modal vs inline for profile settings:** Should profiles open in a modal for quick access, or be
  embedded inline within the settings view?
- **Inline vs full-screen views:** Should settings open up full-screen so the new settings could also be used in Vero 1.0?

    src={accountProfileModalTypeImage}

    src={inlineFullScreenImage}
    alt="Inline settings vs full-screen settings"
  />

</figure>

I explored ways to differentiate project-level and user-level settings, and how
multiple projects should be represented in the sidebar.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10">
  <figure class="col-span-1 !my-0 md:col-span-2">
    <Image
      class="rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50"
      src={settingsSidebarsImage}
      alt="Settings sidebar exploration"
    />
    <figcaption>Settings sidebar exploration</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="col-span-1 !my-0">
    <Image
      class="rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50"
      src={nestedProjectsImage}
      alt="Nested projects"
    />
    <figcaption>Nested projects</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

I shared these mockups internally to gather feedback early. This collaborative process helped me evaluate trade-offs due to balancing business goals and technical constraints.

### Concepts Not Pursued

To align with business goals, some features were moved to phase 2, allowing us to prioritise core features for a faster launch. One of these decisions included removing the 'add new project' feature, enabling us to deliver a leaner MVP within the 8-week timeframe.

    src={switcherNewProjectImage}
    alt="Switcher new project"
  />

### Refining Design

I refined the mockups to balance usability, visual consistency, and technical constraints. During implementation once the bulk of the engineering work was done I jumped in to the code to do some design polish like refining spacing to ensure a more consistent and scalable experience.

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-10">
  <figure class="col-span-1">
    <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50">
      <Image
        class="!my-0 rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl"
        src={dataFeedsImage}
        alt="Data feeds"
      />
    </div>
    <figcaption>Data feeds</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="col-span-1 md:col-span-2">
    <div class="overflow-hidden rounded-3xl bg-cyan-50">
      <Image
        class="!my-0 rounded-3xl drop-shadow-xl"
        src={teamMembersImage}
        alt="Team members"
      />
    </div>
    <figcaption>Team members</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

## Release and iterate

Post-release feedback revealed that the sidebar in the settings section felt visually disconnected from the rest of the app—due to differences in width and styling compared to the non-settings sidebar. To address this, I led a refinement of the layout by standardising the width and
aligning the styles of the settings sidebar to improve visual consistency.

<figure>
  <div class="rounded-4xl overflow-hidden bg-cyan-50">
    <Image
      class="drop-shadow-xl"
      src={settingsSidebarTweaksImage}
      alt="Settings sidebar tweaks"
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption>Settings sidebar tweaks post-launch</figcaption>

## What I learned

As a result of relasing the redesign settings, support requests related to user and project settings decreased, contributing to less customer frustration.
