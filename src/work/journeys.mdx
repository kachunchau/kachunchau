## Release and iterate

I was involved throughout the 6 week cycle and led the UI design for the core Journey experience, including the React canvas, node interactions, and reporting layout.

While I was made redundant shortly before the public launch of Journeys, I worked closely with engineering and product to ensure the designs were implementation-ready. This included:

- Finalised Sketch flows and handoff docs.
- Component specs for node types and edge states.
- Error and loading states for reporting metrics.
- Guidance on post-MVP enhancements (eg node-level reporting, versioning, etc).

The team planned to roll out Journeys with campaign-level reporting (entries, exits, completions, and “here now” states), with phased support for draft saving and version control. While I wasn't there for the final release, I was proud to have helped shape and build the foundation for what shipped.
