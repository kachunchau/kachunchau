## Overview

Redesign and build of Vero's multi-message journey builder to support event-triggered campaigns, real-time reporting, and improved editing experience over 6 weeks. I led the UI design in a team of 5 (Head of Product, Product Designer, and 3 Engineers) where the UX has already been done by the Head of Product.

## The Problem

Users want to send automated multi-message campaigns triggered by events in
Vero 2.0. They want to be able to easily visualise the logic of the multi-message
campaign and be able to analyse and report on how their customers travel
through the steps of the campaign and easily update the campaign with changes.

## Goals

- Multi-message event triggered campaigns in Vero 2.0.
- Improved editing experience with no saving issues
- Visual reporting on the canvas showing how many customers reached each
  node.
- Able to migrate some customer campaigns to Vero 2.0 (if not using ab/testing
  or languages).

## Process

## Release and iterate

I was involved throughout the 6 week cycle and led the UI design for the core Journey experience, including the React canvas, node interactions, and reporting layout.

While I was made redundant shortly before the public launch of Journeys, I worked closely with engineering and product to ensure the designs were implementation-ready. This included:

- Finalised Sketch flows and handoff docs.
- Component specs for node types and edge states.
- Error and loading states for reporting metrics.
- Guidance on post launch features (eg node-level reporting, versioning etc).

The team planned to roll out Journeys with campaign-level reporting (entries, exits, completions, and “here now” states), with phased support for draft saving and version control. While I wasn't there for the final release, I was proud to have helped shape and build the foundation for what shipped.
