<CaseStudyCallout description="Vero's brand lacked visual consistency across their marketing and product touch points. This involved adapting the refreshed design system ensuring everything felt intentional. The work helped unify Vero's visual identity and set a stronger foundation for future design consistency." />

## The Problem

- Core areas—like the marketing site, login/signup, blog, and help docs—felt
  disconnected and outdated.
- No consistent pattern library for all of Vero's marketing touch points.
- There was no unified approach to applying brand visuals across social media
  platforms.

## Goals

- Collaborate on a full redesign of the Vero brand and design system, and lead
  the implementation and adaptation of the new visual identity across all Vero
  touch points to ensure a cohesive and modern brand experience.
- Build and maintain a pattern library for all of Vero touch points using
  Nunjucks templating.
- Continuously evolve the pattern library to reflect the ongoing brand refresh
  and fix visual inconsistencies across components.

  These are just a collection of things I've done on the public facing sites
  over the past few years.

Most recently we had some feedback re: the home page. That it wasn't marketer
friendly for a marketing software. I explored different styles for the hero
section to quickly share to the internal team.
