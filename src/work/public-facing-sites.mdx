<CaseStudyCallout description="Vero's brand lacked visual consistency across their marketing and product touch points. This involved adapting the refreshed design system ensuring everything felt intentional. The work helped unify Vero's visual identity and set a stronger foundation for future design consistency." />

## The Problem

- Core areas—like the marketing site, login/signup, blog, and help docs—felt
  disconnected and outdated.
- No consistent pattern library for Vero's public-facing sites.
- There was no unified approach to applying brand visuals across social media
  platforms.

## Goals

- Collaborate on a full redesign of the Vero brand and design system, and lead
  the implementation and adaptation of the new visual identity across all Vero
  touch points to ensure a cohesive and modern brand experience.
- Design, build and maintain a pattern library for Vero marketing site, Help Center using
  Nunjucks templating.
- Continuously evolve the pattern library to reflect the ongoing brand refresh
  and fix visual inconsistencies across components.

This is a selection of work I've done on Vero's public-facing sites over the past few years.

We recently received feedback that the homepage didn't feel marketer-friendly, especially for a marketing-focused product. In response, I explored a variety of hero section styles to better align with marketing expectations and shared these concepts internally.

Once the core styles were locked in, the rest of the homepage came together more smoothly, building on that visual foundation.
